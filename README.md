Competition
===========

My attempt at a local competition.
http://codemint.com/codingchallenge.html

The application assumes that each subfolder in the treestructure is named after the year
of its gathered data.

It is also assumed that each folder has a collection of .gz files containing files
formated according to ISD-lite format.
ftp://ftp3.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/noaa/isd-lite/isd-lite-format.txt

The application takes 3 arguments: rootfolder for the files, outputfile and an optional
error outputfile.
